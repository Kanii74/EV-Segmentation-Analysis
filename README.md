In this report, we have done a data study of the ELECTRIC VEHICLE Market in India and performed Segmentation processes on it using Python and machine learning tech- niques. A lot of efforts were put into finding the datasets and extracting them from internet sources. As a team working in an Electric Vehicle Startup, we are still deciding in which vehicle/customer space it will develop its EVs.

The study was performed on the 2-Wheeler EV which has had the highest sales and revenue in the past few years. The Segmentation task was done using Python and ma- chine learning algorithms(k-means) and the optimal number of segments to be found was 4. We also find that out of the four segments (0,1,2 and 3), segment 1 turned out to be the most opportunistic for the startup. I have also depicted through plots how the segment data can be visualized and understood.

Furthermore, I have also come to a conclusion that will guide our team in building the future of our startup.
